A comprehensive web-based tool for creating and configuring analytics rules for security detection systems. This wizard provides a guided, step-by-step interface to generate properly structured JSON rule configurations.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ **Rule Type Support**
- **Context Feature Rules**: Statistical and behavioral analysis rules
- **Fact Feature Rules**: Event-based detection rules  
- **Count Profile Rules**: Threshold and counting-based rules
- **Histogram Rules**: Distribution analysis rules
- **Custom Rules**: Flexible rule definitions

### ðŸ“‹ **6-Step Wizard Process**

1. **Choose Rule Type** - Select the appropriate rule category for your detection needs
2. **Basic Rule Information & Classification** - Configure rule metadata, family, and group classification
3. **Detection Configuration** - Set up detection parameters, scope, and MITRE ATT&CK mappings
4. **Event Filtering & Conditions** - Define filtering criteria and conditional logic
5. **Advanced Settings** - Fine-tune behavior, thresholds, and maturity levels
6. **Review and Generate** - Preview configuration and export JSON rule file

### ðŸ”§ **Key Capabilities**

- **MITRE ATT&CK Integration**: Built-in support for mapping rules to MITRE tactics and techniques
- **Rule Classification**: Organized family and group categorization system
- **Template ID Generation**: Automatic generation of unique rule identifiers

### ðŸ“Š **Rule Families & Groups**

The wizard includes pre-configured rule families such as:
- Authentication & Access Control
- Data Exfiltration & Loss Prevention
- Malware & Threat Detection
- Network Security & Traffic Analysis
- Privilege Escalation & Lateral Movement
- System & Process Monitoring
- User Behavior Analytics
- And many more...

## Usage

### Getting Started

1. Open `nsa-rule-wizard.html` in any modern web browser
2. Follow the step-by-step wizard to configure your rule
3. Export your completed rule as a JSON file

### Example Workflow

1. **Select Rule Type**: Choose "Context Feature" for behavioral analysis
2. **Configure Basic Info**: 
   - Enter rule name: "Suspicious Login Patterns"
   - Add description and select appropriate family/group
3. **Set Detection Parameters**: 
   - Configure detection scope and timeframes
   - Map to relevant MITRE ATT&CK techniques
4. **Define Filtering**: Specify event types and conditional logic
5. **Advanced Settings**: Set thresholds and maturity level
6. **Export**: Download the generated JSON rule file
